# neck's manga tools
I mostly read (and therefore rip/prepare/archive) official digital volumes, so the tools in this repo may make some shortsighted assumptions based on that.

I'm adding stuff as I split it out from my previous script but they will probably need additional changes to work properly as modules. I don't really know anything about that yet, but can see some obvious issues arising with the way everything is currently structured (if you could even call it that). I'll actually learn something and fix them later maybe.

Since I'm splitting these out of a much worse all-in-one script I normally use, they are barely tested. Make backups of your files and use at your own risk. Use `--dry-run` where applicable.

### Most of these expect to be run from within the directory containing your images.
### Most of these operate on images in-place.
