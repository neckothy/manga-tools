# neck's manga tools
I mostly read (and therefore rip/prepare/archive) official digital volumes, so the tools in this repo may make some shortsighted assumptions based on that.

I'll probably add more stuff as I get around to rewriting them to be less bad (they'll still be bad)

Since I'm rewriting these out of a much worse, all-in-one script I normally use, they might not be extensively tested. Make backups of your files and use at your own risk. Use `--dry-run` where applicable.

### Most of these expect to be run from within the directory containing your images.
