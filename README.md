# neck's manga tools
Personal scripts I use for organizing my digital manga purchases.

I mostly read [official digital volumes](https://gist.github.com/neckothy/6654f928fef87529646df3799f5e555a), so the tools in this repo may make some shortsighted assumptions based on that.

See [the wiki](https://github.com/neckothy/manga-tools/wiki) for requirements, warnings, and other documentation
